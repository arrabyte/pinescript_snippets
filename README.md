# TradingVew/pinescript snippets and strategies

This repo contains strategies for tradingview, you can freely use this code at your risk, 
as strategies are for educational purpose. Some of these strategies were profitable in the past but there is no guaranties of 
future profitability. It's at your own risk. 

Mavezo strategy is based on EMAs and VZO oscillator, is ready to be used with Wundertrading (below my referral) 
but you can adapt the code to use your preferred exchange.
Mavezo settings contains configuration (and metric) for specific token.
